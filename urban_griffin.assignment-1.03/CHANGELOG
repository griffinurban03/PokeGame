2/3 4:30 PM  - Initialized Project
2/3 5:40 PM  - Created Map files to build world off off..
2/3 6:00 PM  - Got the map to print 80x21 characters to the terminal.
2/3 6:30 PM  - Created an enum for terrain types, followed Jeremy's advice and set seed cells to build upon.
2/3 6:50 PM  - Finished algorithm for growing terrain from seeds, map is given 1000 iterations to grow cells, each iteration randomly tries to grow cells
2/3 9:00 PM  - Created 2 methods to place borders '%' around the edge of the map, and to place path/gate/exits along the border.
2/4 11:00 AM - Added new variables in map.h header file to store map gate locations
2/4 1:30 PM  - Added placeholder pathing function, simply chooses random midpoint, and respective gates grow toward mid.
2/4 3:00 PM  - Added function to place pokemarts and pokecenters that are 2x2 and adjacent to paths, without overlapping paths
2/4 4:00 PM  - Fixed bug with pokemarts/centers that caused them to still be created on top of pathways
2/4 8:00 PM  - Finalized code for now and tarball-ing for submission
2/4 9:55 PM  - Reuploading because I forgot to make clean
2/6 2:00 PM  - Created a new header file for worlds
2/6 3:45 PM  - Implemented data structure to hold individual maps in 2d array, and world.c file
2/9 5:00 PM  - Refactored the map.c and pokegame.c to dynamically allocate space for new worlds
2/9 8:00 PM  - Implemented commands (n,e,s,w,q,fxy) and allowed the player to move between locations
2/10 4:40 PM - Added gate checking to each new loaded map, allowing gates to connect between maps
2/11 6:00 PM - Fixed an issue caused by variable swapping in which moving north caused a crash
2/11 7:00 PM - Fixed an issue that prevented maps from being cleared correctly
2/11 7:30 PM - Implemented probability for pokecenters/marts placement according to Manhattan distance
2/11 8:00 PM - Fixed an issue that caused pokemarts to spawn on pokecenters
2/11 8:30 PM - Prepared 1.02 for submission.
2/12 10:00 AM- Moved variable definitions into world.c to remove magic numbers
2/12 10:15 AM- Fixed an issue where first map would display coords incorrectly
2/12 4:00 PM - Cleaned up command switch statement to make it more readable, added more comments to pokegame.c
2/12 4:15 PM - Added screen clearing between maps
2/18 3:30 PM - Reworked path generation, using a midpoint between center + edge to path to
2/18 4:00 PM - Fixed a big where NS paths werent lining up always
2/18 4:30 PM - Reworked map data structure, no longer a 2D char array, but like Jeremys approach, uses
	       an array of enums for terrain types. A final pass goes through the array and assigns chars to types
2/18 5:15 PM - Reworked pathing logic to prevent paths from forming on the edges of the world.
2/18 6:00 PM - Redid terrain generation method using cellular automata approach. Creates biomes that grow and a smoothing noise function to create nicer looking terrain
2/18 7:30 PM - Finished CA method and biome helper method, and created a pass function to add trees at bases of mountains
