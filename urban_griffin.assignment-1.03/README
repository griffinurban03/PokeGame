Assignment 1.02 - Map to Map

Hi TA,

This implementation of assignment 1.02.

This code builds upon assignment 1.01 to create a big wide beautiful world! In a new header file, world.h I define the structure of world to hold all of the 'maps'. Im using the term 'map' to describe the single 80x21 terrain gen you see on the screen. The 'world' is made up of 401x401 'maps'. On initialization, every 'map' in the 'world' is defined to null, except for the starting map. From there, any 'maps' moved to by the player will be malloced, created, and rendered to the screen. maps are persistent between transitions, so moving e, w, e, w, e, w, e, w will show you the same two maps.

Gates are also tracked in each map, meaning that gate exits line up between map transitions. This is simply done by checking neighbors exit locations (if they exist) when creating the paths in a new map.

Additionally, this code allows us to use custom commands! use n, e, s, w to move from map to map. Use q to quit, and use f x y to 'fly' to x and y coordinates. Do not attempt to fly off the map, because you cant. nor can you walk across the map border. That being said, I did not figure out how to prevent the gates from spawning along the world border yet, so gates appear that technically lead to nowhere. However, I implemented a simple check and prevent the player from loading maps outside of our area, and simply write an error to the console screen without terminating the program.

Finally, I implemented the equation listed in the pdf to have pokecenter and pokemart falloff as you move further away from the center (0, 0). 

All code written in C.

If there are any questions about the code please feel free to reach out at griffinu@iastate.edu
